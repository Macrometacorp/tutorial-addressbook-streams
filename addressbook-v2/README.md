# 1. Overview

Demo to show custom C8Fn and real-time capabilities of Macrometa.

# 2. How to run app locally

If `node_modules` is not there, execute `npm install`.

Once all the node modules have been installed execute `npm start` to start the development server. This will start a local development server on `localhost:<some_port>`.

# 3. Prerequisites

Once you have the app running, you will need to login with your Macrometa account information.

```js
email: name@youremail.com
```

Your fabric name will be:

```js
fabric: _system
```

Now use the password you use to log into Macrometa.

If you haven't already, please [walk through the tutorial](https://macrometa.dev/demos/address-book/) in our docs, so the required collection is set up!
